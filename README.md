Welcome to the CS52 workshop session on Bootstrap.  During this workshop, you will learn the basics of using
the Bootstrap framework by using it to create a clean, responsive, and mobile friendly web page.

## Workshop Overview

For this workshop, you will be asked to incorporate many of the components of Bootstrap into a simple website.
Your challenge, should you choose to accept it (lol) is:

    Take the poorly-formatted and un-styled html that we have provided for you in this workshop
    and use Bootstrap to turn it into a masterpiece, without using any CSS.  We will be having
    a competition to see who can create the best website.

In order to complete the challenge, follow these steps

* [Set up Bootstrap](#setup)
* [Create the Nav Bar](#nav-bar)
* [Encapsulate Content in a Grid Layout](#grid-layout)

## Setup

Setting up bootstrap is simple - all you have to do is link it into the html from a CDN.  For example,
you can link in Bootstrap by including the following lines in the <head> of your HTML:

## Nav Bar

To get started, we will begin by setting up a simple nav-bar for the site.  Bootstrap provides many
different classes that can be used to customize a nav bar.  To customize the nav bar using Bootstrap,
incorporate Bootstrap classes into the <nav></nav> section of the HTML.  For some examples, use the
W3Schools tutorial [here](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_navbar.asp).

## Grid Layout

The HTML that we have provided for you is laid out vertically.  Use the Bootstrap preset grid layout to
align the content in an arrangement that is more visually appealing.

### Presentation Section

~(10-15 minutes)

* motivate the technology
* show where the technology fits into the web dev process (dev tool, frontend framework, preprocessor, language etc)
* show some use cases
* discuss pros/cons

You may use any presentation technology, although [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) is particularly fitting as an open source javascript library, and supports code blocks. :gem:

### Tutorial Section

(~30 minutes)

Your written tutorial document will be a walkthrough of building something using the specific web technologies.

It should include:

* Overview of what will be attempted
* Any necessary setup steps
* Step by step instructions
* Explanations of the what **and** the why behind each step. Try to include:
  * higher level concepts
  * best practices

Remember to explain any notation you are using.

```javascript
/* and use code blocks for any code! */
```
