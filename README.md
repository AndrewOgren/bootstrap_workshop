Welcome to the CS52 workshop session on Bootstrap.  During this workshop, you will learn the basics of using
the Bootstrap framework by using it to create a clean, responsive, and mobile friendly web page.

## Workshop Overview

For this workshop, you will be asked to incorporate many of the components of Bootstrap into a simple website.
Your challenge, should you choose to accept it (lol) is:

    Take the poorly-formatted and un-styled html that we have provided for you in this workshop
    and use Bootstrap to turn it into a masterpiece, without using any CSS.

In order to complete the challenge, follow these steps

* [Set up Bootstrap](#setup)

* [10-15 Minute Intro Presentation](#presentation-section)
* [30 Minute Tutorial](#tutorial-section)
* [5-10 Minute Wrap-Up Discussion](#wrap-up-discussion-section)

## Setup

Setting up bootstrap is simple - all you have to do is link it into the html from a CDN.  For example,
you can link in Bootstrap by including the following lines in the <head> of your HTML:
